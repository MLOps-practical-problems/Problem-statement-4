# MLOps Practice Project

## Problem Statement 4: Creating a Reproducible ML Pipeline using Jupyter and Virtual Environment

This repository is a part of my MLOps practice exercises. The objective of this project is to build a reproducible machine learning pipeline using **Jupyter Notebook** and a **virtual environment**.

### Tasks
- Set up a virtual environment using `venv`.
- Install necessary libraries (`scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `jupyter`).
- Load the Wine dataset from `sklearn.datasets`.
- Perform basic data preprocessing.
- Train a simple machine learning model.
- Save environment dependencies to `requirements.txt`.
- Share the notebook and setup instructions for easy reproduction.

### Dataset
- **Wine Dataset**:
  - Contains chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region.
  - 13 features like alcohol, malic acid, ash, alcalinity, magnesium, etc.
  - Target variable: Wine class (0, 1, 2).
